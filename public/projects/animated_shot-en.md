## Animated Screenshot

![main_image](/public/images/keyboard_cat.gif)

Animated screenshot is an application developed in Java mainly with Swing and some bindings on a native library (Xuggler).

It gives you the ability to capture a screen area and then, show a little editor with some options (re-size, crop, frame-rate, yoyo, etc...). It then converts the result to GIF format and offer to send the output on an image host.

The application did not get published because it suffers from too heavy memory consumption when the video sequence was toot long or was captured with too big resolution.
The impossibility to manually manage the memory in Java made that I put the project on the side.

I captured a little GIF on Youtube for the example.
