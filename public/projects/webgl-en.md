## WebGL Three & Phaser

Its is not really a project in particular but, in the last months, I got interested in new web related technologies. And, with WebGL whose support is becoming better and better, I made some *demos*.

### Brick

A little demo made with Phase whose initially was a brick-breaker ... But it's not about bricks anymore. :D

There are no enemies, not real goal. We can only move, shoot and wrap from one side of the screen to the other.
Finally I find Phaser quite enjoyable to work with, even if we can feel sometime the limited freedom.

### Game Engine

A little game engine based on the 3D library ThreeJS, not mush features. We can move around and there is an embed physical engine (oimo.js).
