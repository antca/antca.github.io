##Live Player

Live Player is an alternative player for Dailymotion livestreams. It is in development with ReactJS and the Dailymotion's API.

I wanted to understand better how ReactJS works so, I started to develop this project whose offer a more comfortable user interface to watch Dailymotion live streams (more services will be usable later). My goal is to provide a unified application for livestreams.

At the moment, It offers quite a limited set of functionalities (channel saving, show preview, channel ranking, etc...) but other features will come later (command via smartphone, chat, etc...).
