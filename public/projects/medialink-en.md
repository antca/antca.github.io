## MediaLink

![main_image](/public/images/medialink.png)

Medialink is a little app developed in early 2014 to learn how to use the the native Android API.

Under a simple appearance it employs a good amount of the Android system functionalities (network, notifications, services, storage, content sharing, ...).

*MediaLink gives you the ability to get a link to share any media you want the simplest possible way.*

*MediaLink is powered by the great hosting media website, MediaCrush (https://mediacru.sh/ ).
The app doesn't require any login and you can only access the files via the generated link (all your uploads are private).*

*Just look for the share button on your favorite multimedia app to share what you want (works with most of image,audio and video formats), click on it and choose MediaLink in the list. 
You can follow the uploading process in the notifications and then copy the link to your clipboard.*

*MediaLink provide a history for your uploaded files, so you can easily keep track of what you did and even delete your files on the MediaCrush servers in some circumstances (if your IP address didn't change since the upload actually). Obviously, you can clear the history or dismiss records one by one with a simple swipe move.*

The sources are not available at the moment but, I planned to publish them after some cleaning/bugfixes...

**REM (31/01/2015) : The service on which the app is based ([MediaCrush](https://www.mediacru.sh/)) has recently stopped. So, I think I will update the app really soon. I removed the download link by the way.**
