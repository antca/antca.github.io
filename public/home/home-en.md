# **Anthony Camboni**
## **web developer**
<br />

Recently graduated in Information Technology and Systems (Bachelor), I am looking for a job in the IT field, especially as a web developer.
My Bachelor degree is not directly about web development but I started to get interested in that field about a year ago. Since then I invest a lot of time learning and practicing by myself.

I began with NodeJS and the JavaScript ecosystem and I am now learning PHP more in depth to become a more versatile web developer.
Also, I developed other software before that, mainly in Java. 
You can check my personnal projects in the dedicated section: [projects](#/projects).
I also have a good knowledge in system administration (Linux and Windows) and also networks (CCNA).

Now that I finished my studies, I can't wait to work on web projects as a full-time job!


If you want to know a bit more about my qualifications, you can check my [resume](#/resume).

You can contact me by email at the address **anthony(at)camboni.be** or via the [contact form](#/contact).

I hope we get in touch soon !

#### Enjoy the visit!
